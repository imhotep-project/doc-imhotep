# 1. Context of the project

## 1.1 Objectives

The main goal of the OST-ST IMHOTEP project is to investigate the response of the global ocean to fully-varying freshwater discharges from rivers and from the Greenland ice sheet between 1980 and 2018. We are investigating this response in terms of sea surface salinity (SSS), regional sea surface height (SSH) and its manometric/steric components, heat and freshwater contents, water mass properties, regional to basin-scale circulation, etc. We are currently analyzing satellite/in-situ observations and the outputs from a recent series of NEMO-based global ocean/sea-ice/iceberg 1/4° simulations where runoffs are individually set to climatological OR fully-variable in various source regions.

Daily river discharge data are derived from the ISBA-CTRIP hydrological reanalysis  (Decharme et al., 2019), and monthly (solid and liquid) freshwater discharges from Greenland are derived from satellite altimetry data (SAR mode) combined with regional climate simulations (Mouginot et al., 2019). Special attention was dedicated to the bathymetry and the partitioning  between solid and liquid discharges all around Greenland, in order to realistically feed icebergs and freshwater plumes. The JRA55 fully-variable atmospheric forcing is applied in all simulations without any SSS relaxation, which is replaced by a precipitation correction term that lets surface tracers free to evolve.

On-going studies led by the projects partners (IGE, Datlas, LOPS, LEGOS) currently focused on the regional response in the Arctic region, in the Bay of Bengal, in the Amazon outh, as well as on the global scale.
