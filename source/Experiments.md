### 1.c Spinup 
Experiment IMHOTEP.02 is the spinup of the WP1 experiments. It ran from 1968 to 2018, starting from climatological initial state.  All other WP1 experiments are initialized from a restart file from IMHOTEP.02 on 1980-01-01.

### 1.d Technical details about the making of the NEMO configuration and experiments
* The technical doc and details on each simulations can be found [here](https://github.com/molines/IMHOTEP/tree/master/eORCA025),

## 2. WorkPackage 2 experiments (Ensemble experiments):

### 2.a Summary
3 ensembles of 10 members each have been produced over 1980-2018. Their names follow the same conventions as in WP1, but start with the "E" of Ensemble:
- EGAI,
